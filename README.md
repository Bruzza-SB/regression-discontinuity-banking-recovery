# Regression Discontinuity - Banking Recovery
In the context of banking recovery, a significant phase arises known as "regression discontinuity." This phase occurs when a bank encounters an account that has been officially labeled as "uncollectible" due to debt. Despite this classification, the bank does not abandon attempts to recover the owed amount. Rather, the bank is determined to recuperate a portion of the outstanding funds. To gauge the potential recovery amount, the bank employs a scoring system that considers factors such as the likelihood of payment, total debt, and various variables impacting the customer's ability and willingness to pay.

Distinct recovery strategies have been established by the bank, each associated with different monetary thresholds (e.g., $1000, $2000). The level of effort exerted by the bank in contacting the customer escalates as the projected recovery amount increases. For cases involving minimal recovery amounts (termed "Level 0"), the bank simply integrates the customer's contact information into their automated communication systems, like dialers and emails. However, for more substantial recovery amounts, the bank incurs additional costs by engaging human resources to intensify payment collection efforts. With each higher level of recovery strategy, an extra cost of $50 per customer is incurred. Consequently, customers classified under Recovery Strategy Level 1 add $50 to the company's expenses compared to those in Level 0. Similarly, customers in Level 2 incur an additional cost of $50 compared to Level 1, and so forth.

The pivotal inquiry here is: Does the augmented recovery amount achieved through the more advanced strategy levels surpass the supplementary cost of $50? Stated differently, is there a discernible leap (referred to as a "discontinuity") of over $50 in the recovered amount upon transitioning to higher strategy levels? The answer to this question will be unraveled in the ensuing analysis.
